## Data Types and Structures

### vtkDataObject
* Base class for all data objects in VTK
* Stores data and metadata, such as geometric and topological information
* Common subclasses include:
  - vtkImageData
  - vtkRectilinearGrid
  - vtkStructuredGrid
  - vtkPolydata
  - vtkUnstructuredGrid

### vtkImageData
* Regular grid with fixed topology and uniform spacing between points
* Useful for representing volumetric data, such as images or 3D scalar fields
* Examples: CT scans, MRI scans

### vtkRectilinearGrid
* Regular grid with fixed topology but non-uniform spacing between points
* Useful for representing data with varying resolution along different axes
* Examples: climate data, terrain elevation data

### vtkStructuredGrid
* Curvilinear grid with fixed topology
* Useful for representing data on a curvilinear coordinate system
* Examples: fluid flow around objects, finite volume method simulations

### vtkPolydata
* Represents a dataset of points, vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips
* Useful for representing surface meshes and 3D models
* Examples: 3D object models, terrain surfaces

### vtkUnstructuredGrid
* Irregular grid with flexible topology
* Can contain any kind of geometric primitive and mix different structures
* Useful for representing complex geometries and adaptive meshes
* Examples: finite element method simulations, complex 3D geometries

### Structured vs Unstructured Grid
* Structured grids: regular grid with fixed topology
  - Easier to work with and more memory-efficient
  - Examples: vtkImageData, vtkRectilinearGrid, vtkStructuredGrid
* Unstructured grids: irregular grid with flexible topology
  - More versatile, but harder to work with and less memory-efficient
  - Example: vtkUnstructuredGrid

### Multiblock Dataset
* A dataset containing multiple individual datasets
* Useful for handling complex, hierarchical data structures
* Examples: multi-domain simulations, multi-resolution data

### Choosing the Right Data Structure
* Consider the geometry, topology, and resolution of your data
* The choice of data structure affects memory usage, processing time, and ease of use
* Some data structures can be converted to others, but not always without loss of information

### vtkImageData
* Regular grid with fixed topology and uniform spacing between points
* Useful for representing volumetric data, such as images or 3D scalar fields
* Examples: CT scans, MRI scans

### vtkRectilinearGrid
* Regular grid with fixed topology but non-uniform spacing between points
* Useful for representing data with varying resolution along different axes
* Examples: climate data, terrain elevation data

### vtkStructuredGrid
* Curvilinear grid with fixed topology
* Useful for representing data on a curvilinear coordinate system
* Examples: fluid flow around objects, finite volume method simulations

### vtkPolydata
* Represents a dataset of points, vertices, lines, polygons, and triangle strips
* Useful for representing surface meshes and 3D models
* Examples: 3D object models, terrain surfaces

### vtkUnstructuredGrid
* Irregular grid with flexible topology
* Can contain any kind of geometric primitive and mix different structures
* Useful for representing complex geometries and adaptive meshes
* Examples: finite element method simulations, complex 3D geometries

### Structured vs Unstructured Grid
* Structured grids: regular grid with fixed topology
  - Easier to work with and more memory-efficient
  - Examples: vtkImageData, vtkRectilinearGrid, vtkStructuredGrid
* Unstructured grids: irregular grid with flexible topology
  - More versatile, but harder to work with and less memory-efficient
  - Example: vtkUnstructuredGrid

### Multiblock Dataset
* A dataset containing multiple individual datasets
* Useful for handling complex, hierarchical data structures
* Examples: multi-domain simulations, multi-resolution data

A vtkMultiBlockDataSet is a collection of datasets (blocks) organized in a hierarchical manner. Each block in a vtkMultiBlockDataSet can be an instance of vtkDataSet (or any of its subclasses) or another composite dataset. This allows for a very flexible organization of datasets. For example, you could have a vtkMultiBlockDataSet where one block is a vtkPolyData, another block is a vtkStructuredGrid, and yet another block is another vtkMultiBlockDataSet.

This structure is particularly useful in large simulations where data may be divided into blocks. Each block could represent a different region of the simulation domain or different components of a complex system. The use of composite datasets allows VTK to handle such complex, hierarchical, multi-part datasets in a consistent way.

### Choosing the Right Data Structure
* Consider the geometry, topology, and resolution of your data
* The choice of data structure affects memory usage, processing time, and ease of use
* Some data structures can be converted to others, but not always without loss of information

| VTK Data Object | Purpose | Complexity | Flexibility | Efficiency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PolyData | Represents polygonal data. Commonly used to represent 3D surfaces. | Moderate. Consists of polygons and polylines, can be easily manipulated. | High. Can represent complex and arbitrary shapes. | High. Stores only the data necessary to represent the shape. |
| Structured Grids | Represents a 3D grid of points where the connectivity is implicitly defined. | Low. The data structure is simple and regular, easy to navigate. | Low. Limited to regular grid shapes. | High for regular data, but not efficient for irregular data. |
| Unstructured Grids | Represents an arbitrary collection of cells. Used for complex, irregular shapes that cannot be represented with simpler data types. | High. Requires explicit definition of the connectivity between points. | High. Can represent any shape, regular or irregular. | Low to Moderate. Storage and computational efficiency depend on the complexity of the shapes. |
| Structured Points (ImageData) | Represents a regularly spaced 3D grid of points. Connectivity is implicitly defined. | Low. The data structure is simple, regular and easy to navigate. | Low. Limited to regular grid shapes. | Very High. Extremely efficient for regular data due to implicit connectivity. |
| Rectilinear Grids | Represents a 3D grid of points where spacing can vary along each axis but connectivity is implicitly defined. | Moderate. Allows for variable spacing but maintains a regular structure. | Moderate. More flexible than regular grids but less flexible than unstructured grids. | High. More efficient than unstructured grids for data that fits its structure. |

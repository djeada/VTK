# VTK

Python examples for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

## Overview

* VTK is a powerful high-level 3D graphics and visualization library.
* Widely used for scientific data visualization, 3D graphics, and image processing.
* Provides hundreds of algorithms for various purposes.
* First released in 1993, actively developed and maintained by Kitware Inc.
* Open Source, written in C++, with wrappers for Python, Java, and Tcl.

## Getting Started

### Installation

### Basic Workflow

1. Data input and representation: Select the appropriate data structure for your data.
2. Data manipulation and processing: Apply filters and algorithms to process the data.
3. Visualization and rendering: Use mappers, actors, and renderers to display the data.
4. Interaction and exporting: Add user interactivity and export the visualizations as needed.

# VTK
VTK examples in Python.

## Overview
* Powerful high-level visualization library (with 3D graphics)
* Used for 3D graphics and image processing
* Hundreds of implemented algorithms
* First released in 1993, actively developed and maintained by Kitware Inc.
* Open Source
* Written in C++, with wrappers for Python, Java, and Tcl

## Getting Started

### Installation
* Instructions for installing VTK on various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Visit https://vtk.org/download/ for platform-specific installation guides

### Basic Workflow
1. Data input and representation
2. Data manipulation and processing
3. Visualization and rendering
4. Interaction and exporting

## VTK Library

The VTK library is enormous. How can we find anything useful there? Follow the guidelines below:

* VTK/Common -> core classes.
* VTK/IO -> reading and writing data files.
* VTK/Rendering -> a variety of rendering techinques.
* VTK/Graphics -> 3D data processing filter.
* VTK/Filtering -> pipeline for data processing.
* VTK/Imaging -> filters for image processing.
* VTK/Parallel -> support for parallel processing (MPI).
